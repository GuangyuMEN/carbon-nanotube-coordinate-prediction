# carbon-nanotube-coordinate-prediction

This project is to to develop an ANN prediction model that calculates atomic coordinates of CNTs 
instead of using any simulation software.

It is refered by Acı M, Avcı M. Artificial neural network approach for atomic coordinate prediction of carbon nanotubes[J]. Applied Physics A, 2016, 122(7): 631.
